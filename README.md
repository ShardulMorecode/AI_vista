# AI Vision: PPE and Person Detection

This repository contains the **minimal version** of the **AI Vision** project, designed for detecting **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)** and **persons** using a YOLO-based deep learning model. This version includes only the essential files for inference and prediction.

---

## Project Overview
The project leverages computer vision to:
- Detect individuals in images/videos.
- Detect PPE to ensure safety compliance.

This minimal version allows users to directly utilize the trained models for prediction without needing the full training datasets and scripts.

---

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Identify persons and PPE in real-time.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes weights for efficient inference.
- **Easy Configuration**: Modular YAML configuration for flexibility.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and use the minimal project version:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI_vision.git
cd AI_vision
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed. Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run Inference
Use the `inference.py` script to perform predictions:
```bash
python inference.py --image_path <path_to_image> --config <path_to_config> --weights <path_to_weights>
```
Replace `<path_to_image>`, `<path_to_config>`, and `<path_to_weights>` with appropriate file paths.
