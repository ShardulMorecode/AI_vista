AI Vision: PPE and Person Detection
This repository contains the minimal version of the AI Vision project, designed for detecting personal protective equipment (PPE) and individuals using a YOLO-based deep learning model. The repository includes the trained model weights and essential files required to run inference and make predictions.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a robust computer vision model capable of detecting:

Persons

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

Using advanced techniques and YOLO-based architecture, this system ensures accuracy and real-time performance in various applications, such as safety monitoring on construction sites.

Features
Object Detection: Detects individuals and PPE in images/videos.

Pre-trained Models: Trained weights for high-performance inference.

Configurable: Includes YAML configuration files for easy setup and modifications.
